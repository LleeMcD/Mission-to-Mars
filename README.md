## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a Python webscraping application that would:

- Add the informaton to a locally hosted website. 
- Add scraped data to a Mongo database.

## Screenshots
Some screen shots from the project are below. The related files and images are in the repository for easy reference.

Deliverable 2: Add the code created in Deliverable 1 to the scraping.py file, update the Mongo databse and modify the index.html file so the webpage contains all of the information that was collected in this module including a full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 components. Update the web application to make it mobile-responsive, and two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.
