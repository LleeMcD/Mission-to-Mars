Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 components. Update the web application to make it mobile-responsive. Then add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out. 

Some of the changes made include:

- Color of scraping button changed from blue to red.
- Added responsive thumbnail images that take the viewer to a full sized image when clicked.
- Font style for all headers changed to bold.
- Subtle light grey borders added to images.
